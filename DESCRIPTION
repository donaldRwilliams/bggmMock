Description: Fit Bayesian Gaussian graphical models. The methods are separated into 
    two Bayesian approaches for inference: hypothesis testing and estimation. There are 
    extensions for confirmatory hypothesis testing, comparing Gaussian graphical models, 
    and node wise predictability. These methods were recently introduced in the Gaussian 
    graphical model literature, including
